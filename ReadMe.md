🆕  Current version : 1.2

Getting started:

✅  Set up a MongoDB Atlas free cluster and a simple database named teomongotext, with two collections inside (files and characters). I used the AWS server closest to me to host the database. Create a user and a connection string for said database

✅  Install Java SE 14 or later (Don't forget to set the Java home path) and run the jar using

```
java -jar path/to/TeoMongoText.jar
```

✅  Don't worry about the Settings.ini file, it will be created automatically inside your Documents folder, regardless of the OS you run on.

✅ Navigate to the edit menu and use the option to add your connection string

✅ You should now be connected to your database, ready to sync your next masterpiece 😁
