❗  Currently in development ❗ 

Getting started:

✅ Set up a MongoDB Atlas free cluster and a simple database named teomongotext, with two collections inside (files and characters). I used the AWS server closest to me to host the database. Create a user and a connection string for said database

✅ Install a Java Development Kit (11 or above recommended) or a Java Runtime Enviorment (8 or above recommended)

✅ Compile the app yourself or simply run the jar file. Don't worry about the Settings.ini file, it will be created automatically at the root of the folder that contains the jar or project.

✅ Navigate to the edit menu and use the option to add your connection string

✅ You should now be connected to your database, ready to sync your next masterpiece 😁
